Create a step-by-step implementation plan for the current story in docs/specs/stories.json. Output the plan as Markdown, including:
1) Files to modify
2) New dependencies
3) How you will verify each binary acceptance criterion

Save the plan to .strata/plan.md for later use with /execute command.

Do NOT write any code yet. Only create the plan.
