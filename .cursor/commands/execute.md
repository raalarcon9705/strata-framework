Read the approved plan from .strata/plan.md and execute it. Follow the global rules in .cursor/rules/global.mdc and the specific acceptance criteria from docs/specs/stories.json.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. First, read and understand the plan from .strata/plan.md
2. Implement the code according to the approved plan
3. Follow all rules in .cursor/rules/global.mdc
4. After implementation, TEST and VERIFY your work against EACH acceptance criterion
5. For each criterion, confirm whether it PASSES or FAILS
6. If any criterion fails, fix the issues and re-test
7. Only indicate completion when ALL acceptance criteria pass your own verification
8. Provide a summary of your self-verification results before indicating completion

CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS:
- Do NOT update docs/specs/stories.json - The autopilot script handles this
- Do NOT modify logs/progress.txt - The autopilot script handles this after human verification

Do NOT ask the human to verify until you have completed your own testing and confirmed all criteria pass.
